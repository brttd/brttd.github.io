My personal websites, for 3D art and programming. Both are responsive desktop/mobile sites, serving as a info + portfolio website.

[brettdoyle.art](https://brettdoyle.art) has a portfolio of digital 3D work of mine, and [brttd.github.io](https://brttd.github.io) has a collection of different programming projects I've created.  
The sites are built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'd not used Hugo before, but wanted to use a static site generator to make development quicker and easier.
